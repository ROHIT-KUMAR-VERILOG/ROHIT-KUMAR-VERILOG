👋 Welcome to my GitHub!
I'm Rohit Kumar Singh, a final year B.tech student specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering at GCET Greater Noida.
💻 My passion lies in digital design concepts and I have hands-on experience with languages like C, Verilog HDL, and System Verilog.
🐍 I'm also exploring the world of scripting with Python and Perl.
🛠️ My toolbox includes EDA playground and Mentor Graphics for design exploration.
🚀 I've worked on Xilinx Hlx and Vivado tools, as well as Pspice. 🎓 FPGA, including Spartan 3E and Nexys A7 boards, is familiar territory for me.
📡 Knowledgeable about hardware communication protocols like UART, SPI, and I2C, I also have a strong foundation in CMOS fundamentals and Computer Architecture.
🏗️ Currently, I'm actively engaged in RTL Coding, focusing on design, simulation, and implementation.
